    "- Evaluate the condition, yielding `True` or `False`.\n",

    "\n",
    "**The body of the loop should change the value of one or more variables so that eventually the condition becomes false and the loop terminates.** We call the variable that changes each time the loop executes and controls when the loop finishes the iteration variable.
